# Python Projects

This is a small collection of Python and SQL coding examples. These examples demonstrate advanced data analysis, manipulation, and machine learning techniques, which can be used alongside analytical tools or before using the data elsewhere to complete analytical tasks.

## 1. Data Manipulation
   
File: DataManipulation.py

Description: This project demonstrates advanced data manipulation techniques using pandas. It includes tasks such as cleaning, transforming, and integrating data from multiple sources. The project showcases operations like merging, grouping, and applying custom functions to prepare the data for further analysis.

## 2. Predictive Model
File: PredictiveModel.py

Description: This project builds a predictive model to forecast future demand for products in a retail setting. It involves loading and preprocessing the data, feature engineering, and training a machine learning model using scikit-learn. The project demonstrates the entire workflow from data preparation to model evaluation and prediction.

## 3. Time Series Forecasting
File: TimeSeriesForecasting.py

Description: This project focuses on time series forecasting using historical sales data. It includes steps for data visualization, time series decomposition, and building a forecasting model using ARIMA from the statsmodels library. The project provides insights into trends and seasonality, and it makes future sales predictions.
